# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Business case : The objective of the project was to create a reliable model predicting potential Heart Diseases in people

Problem:
Heart disease is the leading cause of death globally,costing healthcare systems billions each year.

Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common type of heart disease, killing over 370,000 people annually.

Every year about 735,000 Americans have a heart attack. Of these, 525,000 are a first heart attack and 210,000 happen in people who have already had a heart attack.

Heart disease is the leading cause of death for people of most ethnicities in the United States, including African Americans, Hispanics, and whites. For American Indians or Alaska Natives and Asians or Pacific Islanders, heart disease is second only to cancer.

Early detection and intervention are crucial for preventing serious complications and reducing mortality (death).

However, traditional risk assessment methods often lack accuracy and personalization, leading to missed diagnoses and unnecessary interventions.

Solution:
This project proposes developing a heart disease prediction model using machine learning (ML) algorithms.

It will involve:

Task 1: Data Analysis Report: Comprehensive analysis of patient data to identify risk factors and relationships between variables.

Task 2: Machine Learning Model: Building and training an ML model to predict potential heart disease in individuals based on various factors.

Task 3: Hospital Actionable Suggestions: Recommending strategies to integrate model predictions into hospital workflows for targeted screening, personalized prevention, and improved patient outcomes.
